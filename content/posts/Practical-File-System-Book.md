A few years ago I was working in Greece's National Centre of Scientific Research "Demokritos" (https://www.demokritos.gr/) as a system administrator for the Institute of Nuclear and Particle Physics (http://www.inp.demokritos.gr/).

 During my time there, I had the opportunity to have a small part in a project that had to do with a distributed file system that was developed there. That was the trigger for me to start reading up on file systems, distributed or not. 

 I soon came to realize that the filesystem space was quite niche and that for someone to get a good amount of knowledge, one should either be working in this field or works one's way down a rabit hole of papers.

Happily I came across the wonderful book **"Practical File System Design with the Be File System"**, by Dominic Giampaolo.

Dominic Giampaolo is a software engineer known for his expertise in file systems. He is particularly recognized for his work on the Be File System (BFS), which was the primary file system for the Be Operating System (BeOS). He is one of the two engineers that designed and implemented BFS.

Throughout his career, Giampaolo has been involved in the development of various storage and file system technologies. Before working on BeOS, he was at Netscape, contributing to the development of the Netscape web browser. He worked at Apple, where was involved in the development of file systems and related technologies. Notably, he contributed to the APFS (Apple File System), which is the primary file system used in macOS, iOS, tvOS, and watchOS.

His book, **"Practical File System Design with the Be File System"** provides a detailed examination of the BFS. Written in the late 1990s, the book delves into the design and implementation of BFS and is considered a great resource for anyone interested in file system design. It covers topics ranging from the basics of file system concepts to the specifics of BFS's on-disk data structures.

Its an amazing and succint source of knowledge that I was exhilarated to re-discover in my library. It's easily accessible by all in Dominic Giampaolo's website (https://nobius.org/). Here's the link: https://www.nobius.org/dbg/practical-file-system-design.pdf . Enjoy!
